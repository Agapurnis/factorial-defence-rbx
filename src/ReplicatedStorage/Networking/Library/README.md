This is a hastily written custom networking library that I wrote because I felt unhappy with other implementations.

Particularily, the lack of serialization and being able to quickly jump to the source of definitions.

Quite a lot of inspiration was taken from [`@rbxts/netbuilder`](https://github.com/Rimuy/netbuilder), which has most of the features I appreciate besides the two mentioned above (serialization is implemented, but by default it doesn't serialize arrays of serializables).
