## Thank you for your interest in contributing!

As a general rule, here's what you should know.
- Have good intentions when contributing.
- Make an attempt to adopt the same style used in the present code.
- Be aware that this is primarily a learning experience and a personal project alongside a few of my friends. I won't be eager to integrate large-scale changes.
