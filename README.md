## [Factorial Defense](https://www.roblox.com/games/9391297088/Factorial-Defense)

A tycoon game inspired by [Miner's Haven](https://www.roblox.com/games/258258996/Miners-Haven).

I hope to expand it over time to include [Tower Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) elements, such as those from [Tower Defence Simulator](https://www.roblox.com/games/3260590327/Tower-Defense-Simulator).

## Disclaimer

I don't recommend using this as a resource to learn [`roblox-ts`](https://roblox-ts.com/) or [`Flamework`](https://fireboltofdeath.dev/docs/flamework/).

I have no idea what I'm doing, and am almost entirely self-taught.

There will be plenty of mistakes, and that's okay. Practice is progress, after all, and I'm trying to learn.

But please don't be afraid to point out where I've made those mistakes! It helps me improve.
